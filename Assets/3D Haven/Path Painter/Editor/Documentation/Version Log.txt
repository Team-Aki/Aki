[Version 2.1.0b1]
Work started on Path Painter under Unity 5.6. This was almost 3 years before neighbour terrain tiles appeared, and supporting such thing didn't even cross the author, Frank's mind, who was new to Unity at the time.
Version 2 is pretty much a complete rewrite to add that feature. All these features are available in all supported Unity versions (Unity 5.6 and onwards).

Enhancements:
 Improved texturing and straight line performance and a number of other performance optimisation (needed for the more taxing new functionalities).
 Thanks to these performance improvements, the max brush sizes were greatly increased.
 [New] Paint across several terrain tiles.
 [New] Auto Terrain Layer (SplatPrototype in older Unity) propagation.
 Removed the camera from the Demo Scene, because new Unity versions didn't like a camera that was also compatible with older versions.
 [New] Improved GUI.
 [New] Shaping, Texturing and Vegetation Clearing can all be toggled separately.
 [New] Help System with better information.
 Improved tooltips
 The API Painter is no longer static, so one can use several instances of it with different settings.
 The API also supports multi tile painting.
 [New] API 3D Painting - The paths height sticks to the spline, or other points provided. (See documentation for more info)
 [New] API Bulk Painting. Use for the best performance when painting several paths at once. (See documentation for more info)
 The API now takes both a List or an Array of points. Use the overload that best suits your data for best performance.
 [New] Path Painter now remembers your settings for each of your projects, so you can pick up where you left off.
 Improved import and compilation.
 Some improvements to avoid unnecessary value boxing in stroke calculations.
 The demo scene now contains 6 tiles of the demo terrain to provide a multi-tile playground.

Fixes:
 [Fix] Toggle buttons' toggled state was not visible in new Unity (2019.3+) due to Unity's new GUI system.
 [Fix] Path Painter could not be saved in Editor Window Layout.
 [Fix] Unused field warning that affected older Unity.
 [Fix] Occasionally might have unintentionally affected the 'Draw Instanced' setting of terrains in new Unity versions.


[Version 1.2.1]
Enhancements:
 Improved and optimised import & compilation, that result in better performance and reliability during play mode switches, Unity version upgrades, building and other events that involve import and compilation.


[Version 1.2.0]
Enhancements:
 Path Painter now uses the 3D Haven folders.
 Path Painter now uses the 3D Haven menu.
 Improved import and compilation.
 Added the first version of an API that for example can be used to paint paths along Pegasus splines (example in documentation).

Fixes:
 Fixed a glitch with the import package.


[Version 1.1.1]
Fixes:
 Fix for import issue on 2019.1


[Version 1.1]
Enhancements:
 The paint button is now bigger.
 Changed the size hotkeys to CTRL+Q/E. 
 Updated for 2018.3 to use the new terrain API.
 Path Painter can now be placed into any directory.
 Single active terrain is now automatically selected on open.
 Made the status bar hotkey tips adapting to OSX (CTRL/CMD).
 Added visualization to show the active line (editable) and display when straight painting.
 Added a workaround for the Unity bug that causes things not to not render over the terrain in 2018.3.
 Updated warning message for non-square terrains to make it more clear that only square terrains are supported.
 
Fixes:
 Stop null pointer exceptions when the environment changes. Path Painter should now do a much better job recovering from these situations.
 Avoided cursor pointer exceptions on OSX.
